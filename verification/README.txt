The synthtic current velocities are in v_synth.
The "inp.txt", "config" and "res" folders are used for the LAPS simulation. The computed results are in "res_reference".
"ADV_verification.m" provides all the necessary steps to run and check the verification.

In the figures, note that the arrow give the directions but are not to scale with the actual displacemnents. The displacement are checked with TASK = 4 in in "ADV_verification.m".
